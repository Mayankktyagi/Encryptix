The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing the "creditcard.csv" dataset, we aim to preprocess the data, train various algorithms, and evaluate their performance. Our goal is to implement a robust model that can effectively detect fraud, thereby minimizing financial losses and enhancing the security of credit card transactions. The project will focus on optimizing model accuracy while maintaining efficiency and scalability. Additionally, it seeks to provide actionable insights into the factors contributing to fraudulent activities, ultimately offering a reliable solution for real-time fraud detection in the financial sector.
